From my understanding, it's something like this...

After you receive an answer, you have a list of possible targets left.
To find the next guess you're going to make,
you look at every one of those - let's call the current one x -
and find the maximum possible targets left if you were to guess x

To do that, you look over the list of possible targets again,
and for each one (let's call it y),
you figure out what the answer would be if y is the actual target and you were to guess x.

Then you group together all the ys that have the same answer if you were to guess x,
find the group with the biggest size, and that size is the maximum possible targets left for x.
And from there, you pick the x that has the smallest maximum possible targets.
